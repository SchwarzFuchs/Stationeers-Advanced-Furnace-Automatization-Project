# Furnace automatization for the Stationeers game.
## Features:
* Full alloy smelting automatization. You only have to provide gas and resourses.
* System automatically checks if your gases satisfy conditions for smelting and tells you if there are any problems.
* Gas mixing accuracy is >99.5% in favorable conditions.
* System has some settings for using in different conditions without any code changes.

### Name-dependent devices
ICs are adressing some devices by their names. So you should name them the same as in the table, or if you want to name them your own, replace the hashes in the code.

### ICs and their connections
#### Recipe Chip
Allows you to select a recipe and write its parameters to memory. There're 3 versions of code for it, one is universal and the two other ones are optimised for Venus and Vulcan accordingly.

Connections: 
| dN      |  Device        |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| d0 | Dial |
| d1 | Temperature Priority Switch |
| d2 | HotTank* |
| d3 | Start Button |

\* Any one of them
#### Main Chip
Monitors button presses and orchestrates all other chips, except for the Recipe IC.

Connections: 
| dN      |  Device        |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| d0 | StartButton |
| d1 | GasCheckIC |
| d2 | PreProccesIC |
| d3 | FurnaceIC |
| d4 | GasCompositionCheckIC |
| d5 | PrePressurizeIC |  
#### Gas Composition Checker IC
Computes the composition of the gases in the tanks to determine the average number of joules per mole for the more accurate calculations.

Connections: 
| dN      |  Device        |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| d0 | Hot Pipe Analyzer |
| d1 | Cold Pipe Analyzer |
| d2 | Temperature Priority Switch |
| d3 | HotTank* |

\* Any one of them
#### Gas Checker IC
Calculates whether the gases meet the conditions of the selected recipe. Not 100% accurate, so it is recommended to have a reserve of 130-150% (percentages are shown on displays). Especially for the hot gas and especially when you use a lot of ingridients at once.

Connections: 
| dN      |  Device        |

| d0 | Cold Gas Check Switch |
| d1 | Hot Pipe Analyzer |
| d2 | Temperature Priority Switch |
| d3 | Cold Pipe Analyzer |
| d4 | LED |
| d5 | Klaxon |
#### PreProcessing IC
Processes ore and ingots to load them into the furnace chamber. Imporant: system won't accept additional resourses after the end of PreProcessing stage but during it you can throw as much as you want up to Advanced Furnace Limit.

Connections:  
| dN      |  Device        |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| d0 | Valve |
| d1 | PreProcessing Pump |

\* Any one of them
#### PrePressurizing IC
Mixes gases and starts pummping mix to the furnace.

#### Furnace IC
Ends pumping, releases alloy when it's ready, —Ålears remaining gases from the system.

Connections: 
| dN      |  Device        |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| d0 | Klaxon |
| d1 | Hot/Cold Mix Pump |
| d2 | LED |
| d3 | Hot/Cold Mix Pipe Analyzer |
| d4 | Furnace |    

## Important
### Setting switches
* Cold Gas Check Switch - When set to 1, makes system think that you always have enough cold gas even if tanks are currently empty. Use it on planets where you're not limited in cold gas, like Mars and Europe.
* Temperature Priority Switch  - When set to 1, the system will use as little cold gas as possible. Use it when you are short on cold gas.
### Advices
* Volume of pipes between tanks and pumps should be several hundred liters, at least 300. Small volume leads to bad mixing accuracy.
* The system continuously adjusts pump settings, but changes in gas composition and temperature during the smelting process may lead to worse mixing accuracy.
* Don't copy scripts from sample world. They may not contain all the latest improvements over the code in the repository.
* You don't need to turn on all ICs, only the Main and Recipe ones.
* You can connect PreProcessing pump to the cold pipe if your "cold" gas is hotter than 450K. Or to the any other pipe that is hot enough, the furnace waste one for example. Don't forget to change the tank on the IC dials in this case.
### Error messages from klaxon
* Fire - you have volatiles in your pipes/tanks. Remove or burn it.
* Temperature low - your hot gas isn't hot enough.
* One Pressure low - you don't have enough hot gas.
* Temperature high - your cold gas isn't cold enough.
* Two Pressure low - you don't have enough cold gas.
* Three Pressure high - you have water in your pipes/tanks. Remove it.
* System failure - after the attempt to pressurize furnace - for some reason the set temperature and pressure have not been reached or you put the wrong ingridients into the furnace.
